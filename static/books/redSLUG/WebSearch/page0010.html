See http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/itila/ for links. 2.3: Forward probabilities and inverse probabilities 27 Bayesians also use probabilities to describe inferences. 2.3 Forward probabilities and inverse probabilities Probability calculations often fall into one of two categories: forward prob-ability and inverse probability. Here is an example of a forward probability problem: Exercise 2.4.[2, p.40] An urn contains K balls, of which B are black and W = K−B are white. Fred draws a ball at random from the urn and replaces it, N times. (a) What is the probability distribution of the number of times a black ball is drawn, nB? (b) What is the expectation of nB? What is the variance of nB? What is the standard deviation of nB? Give numerical answers for the cases N = 5 and N = 400, when B = 2 and K = 10. Forward probability problems involve a generative model that describes a pro-cess that is assumed to give rise to some data; the task is to compute the probability distribution or expectation of some quantity that depends on the data. Here is another example of a forward probability problem: Exercise 2.5.[2, p.40] An urn contains K balls, of which B are black and W = K − B are white. We define the fraction fB ( B/K. Fred draws N times from the urn, exactly as in exercise 2.4, obtaining nB blacks, and computes the quantity (nB − fBN)2 NfB(1 − fB) . (2.19) z = What is the expectation of z? In the case N = 5 and fB = 1/5, what is the probability distribution of z? What is the probability that z &lt; 1? [Hint: compare z with the quantities computed in the previous exercise.] Like forward probability problems, inverse probability problems involve a generative model of a process, but instead of computing the probability distri-bution of some quantity produced by the process, we compute the conditional probability of one or more of the unobserved variables in the process, given the observed variables. This invariably requires the use of Bayes’ theorem. Example 2.6. There are eleven urns labelled by u & {0, 1, 2, . . . , 10}, each con-taining ten balls. Urn u contains u black balls and 10 − u white balls. Fred selects an urn u at random and draws N times with replacement from that urn, obtaining nB blacks and N − nB whites. Fred’s friend, Bill, looks on. If after N = 10 draws nB = 3 blacks have been drawn, what is the probability that the urn Fred is using is urn u, from Bill’s point of view? (Bill doesn’t know the value of u.) Solution. The joint probability distribution of the random variables u and nB can be written P(u, nB |N) = P(nB | u,N)P(u). (2.20) From the joint probability of u and nB, we can obtain the conditional distribution of u given nB: P(u | nB,N) = P(u, nB |N) (2.21) P(nB |N) = P(nB | u,N)P(u) P(nB |N) . (2.22)
